# Sample Sketch

This is a just a simple sketch used to demonstrate the switching between different sketches.

## Parameters

- Background Colour
- Ball Colour
- XSpeed: slider between 1 and 100 to control the ball speed of the ball in the x direction
- YSpeed: slider between 1 and 100 to control the ball speed of the ball in the y direction

If you change the x speed or y speed it's like the ball has a force being applied to it and it curves.  Kind of fun to play with.
